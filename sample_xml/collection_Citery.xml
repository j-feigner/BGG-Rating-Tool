I&#039;d rather play a simpler, more immediately fun game if we&#039;re looking to fill a half-hour, or just sit down for a longer game that fully realizes all of 7 Wonders&#039; civilization building potential. This is lost somewhere in no-mans-land.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A brutal, incessant tightrope walk to financial viability driven by a route building system that feels distinct from other train games due to the exclusivity of track segments. Age of Steam is downright malevolent, but in a sort of uplifting, encouraging way: I always get the sense that it wants desperately for me to play at my highest ability, and I will continue failing to meet its expectations. 

The mean-streak can occasionally be overbearing rather than endearing though. Everyone always seems one bad delivery away from utter ruin, and it takes dedicated, prolonged, [i]stressful[/i] attention to avoid that possibility.

I know this will sound stupid to the legions of AoS fans that have sunk thousands upon thousands of games into what is clearly a very robust system, but I&#039;m not entirely convinced that the turn order actions are tuned quite right: it sometimes feels like you&#039;re just bidding for Loco. I get that their inherent imbalance is a chief source of bidding incentive, but in my limited experience it feels disproportionately warping. The auction can also get a little weird in the last round, with everyone just shoving stacks and the production/pass actions becoming literally useless.</comment>				</item>

Agricola is a good reminder of what made worker placement so compelling in the first place; you need five things, you have three guys, and you can only place [i]one of them[/i] before your loathsome and greedy opponents are set loose on all this precious stuff. What do you need most?</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Standard matrix-based deduction stapled to a euro game. Nothing significant seems to be gained from the marriage, but much is lost in burying an otherwise approachable puzzle under a mountain of rules. Planet X is still king in this category.

Our first two games were also handily won by whatever player purchased the artifact that lets you lose only one ingredient per test. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not actually overpowered, but it was disproportionately game warping for us.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The Splotteriest Splotter of them all. Prickly as a porcupine, overflowing with bits, and almost nihilistic in its pessimism. Spiritually closer to Roads &amp; Boats/FCM than to Indonesia/TGZ in its emphasis on competing action efficiencies rather than affecting a shared incentive space.

Antiquity is a fairly solitaire affair in the early game, but the level of detail achieved during the first few rounds is impressive despite that. There is a lovely intersection of tight resource management, emergent worker placement, and polyomino puzzling, with deeply integrated opportunity costs between each of these systems.

Once players are forced to expand, however, Antiquity’s base-building roots begin to turn outwards to the shared board, and reading the state of your opponent’s engine becomes vital for good play all the way to the end of the game. This &quot;turning out&quot; narrative is satisfying, especially when so many shared board euros move in exactly the opposite direction.

The variable and flexible win conditions are seemingly brilliant but perhaps fatally imbalanced (is Santa Maria useful as anything other than a foot-shooting device?). Player positions are more fluid than I expected as cathedrals are razed and rebuilt to suit the current game state, but the inherent tempo of the system is rather opaque for the first few games, so it is very clear to me that a player with enough experience with the subtleties of Antiquity’s pacing will simply beat a more inexperienced player every time, even accounting for perfect tactical reads.

Despite that, I like this system quite a lot, and assuming all the players at the table are on equal footing, there’s a striking game in here.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>An unassuming menace: these lovely little trees won&#039;t hesitate to shove your brain through a wood chipper. The balance between playing your trees for points and hoarding your trees for the right to score your points is an agonizing central conflict, and relies on careful, studious card counting. 

The act of playing your trees into a grid to score points is a far less interesting process than the hand-management fight though, requiring pretty much the same layout for every game. It isn&#039;t fatal to the experience, but it adds some complexity for little gain.

There is quite a lot of game in this box for two players. Avoid playing with more due to downtime.</comment>				</item>

Argent isn’t elegant, it isn’t focused, and I’m not sure how much control someone would really have given the heaping servings of chaos, but the whole experience is so immediately fun that I don’t know if I care. I can’t believe it, but you win anime game.</comment>				</item>

Reef Encounter is a clear parallel, and might offer a little more strategic depth, but Arkadia plays faster and feels more focused, so they both can stay!</comment>				</item>

There is a far greater emphasis on card combos in this box, and these interactions are just interesting enough to keep my attention but not so complex as to feel like Ascension is trying to emulate Magic. This sits comfortably in some mysterious, relaxing sweet spot where my brain can wind-down without turning off. I also admire the striking and consistent art style; it&#039;s amazing how far that goes in selling me on a card game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I feel like I finally understand Babylonia after getting a chance to play Samurai. Forget the comparisons to Through the Desert or Tigris or Taj Mahal; in my mind Babylonia is Samurai 2, and it improved upon the design so much as to completely antiquate its predecessor.

The tile laying is more strategic due to the ziggurat bonuses and the need for strong look-ahead to create connected groups, and the scoring has been made far more granular to avoid Samurai’s unsatisfying reliance on thin tie-breakers. This is a reassuring display of Knizia’s continuing insight as a designer.</comment>				</item>

I can already get my fix of positional posturing, engine-building, and high-latency resource management without the burden of a sluggish worker-placement framework and dreary theme.

I will say that despite the dark color palette the quality of the artwork is very high, with one hilariously glaring exception: the actual game board itself. It’s perhaps the most important component in the whole box, and it is the only one that is actively ugly. Bravo.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Bafflingly, offensively ugly; maybe the ugliest game I&#039;ve ever played. There is some soft charm to be found in bad or boring board game art, but not here: it&#039;s simply hideous.

Mechanically, Baseball Highlights is a bit sluggish. The tit-for-tat counter-play during the innings feels pretty automatic and lacking in any sort of tension, and the randomized card market makes synergies and strategic planning almost impossible. I also kind of hate the standard game&#039;s insistence on playing three pointless pre-games before the World Series, with the results determining nothing other than home field advantage.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Lighthearted and dramatic storytelling/auction game that captures the source material&#039;s theme of braggadocious machismo quite vividly. 

I just don&#039;t care for how lenient the risk-taking mechanic feels: it&#039;s hard to push your luck too far, and the penalty for doing so is usually minimal, especially when the alternative of simply bowing out of an auction is a guaranteed late reward that may be just as bad if not worse. Pushing for risks just feels like too much of a non-decision in many rounds, and it makes the auctions devolve quickly into coin-flips where most of the cards that end up on the table aren&#039;t from players&#039; carefully managed hands, but just randomly drawn from the top of the deck. Maybe it should have just been one card per risk?</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>An austere racing game that feels like it should be more explosive than it is. The possibility of stringing together a huge, complicated series of hops to fling a pawn halfway across the circuit is intoxicating, but sacrificing your team&#039;s cohesion in the process makes these moves riskier than they first appear. This is especially true as your pawns begin crossing the finish line and your opportunities to leech off of your opponents inevitably dry up. Billabong has one tenet: stay together or die. I&#039;ve always been deeply frustrated by games where the move that is [i]good[/i] and the move that is [i]fun[/i] aren&#039;t, in fact, the same move, and this is a glaring example. 

This forced conservatism and the constant need for tactical reconsideration as the board changes from turn to turn makes Billabong a very slow game. What should be a thirty minute filler is an hour-plus slog. Add in the fact that the endgame can devolve into weird kingmaking situations from players who are not in contention makes Billabong&#039;s overstayed welcome even more distasteful.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The complexity to size ratio is off the charts here; the rules overhead is beyond prohibitive. The real shame is that the general game-flow is pretty intuitive, but parsing that out from the rules as written is painful. This could have benefitted heavily from some teaching aides or a front-loaded play summary or a split rulebook system ala Root. The rulebook just isn&#039;t great for learning or for reference.

But once that intuitive foundation has been parsed out, the experience is dramatic and humbling and monumental. This almost certainly fails as a purely competitive game, but it tells an immense, rich story.
 
My thoughts will likely evolve (ha) as I explore more of Phil&#039;s designs, especially the rest of this series.</comment>				</item>

What I want is a raucous, stompy game that lives up to a name like &quot;Blood Rage&quot;, but instead this just sort of hobbles along with slow drafts, often anticlimactic battles, and a lot of private upgrade management.

People like to bring up runaway leader problems for games that don&#039;t deserve it, but this is a rare exception where I think the critique is justified. There  is almost no compensation given to losing armies in regards to board state or action economy, and the winners are unilaterally rewarded with increases in both. Early pillage winners can just  feel unstoppable at times. When every  player is perfectly  checking the power of every other player the system works, but the balance is too delicate.

The minis also add to the cost but don&#039;t add to the game, and the depiction of women in an exclusively female tribe all clad in fur bikinis feels really slimy for a game that came out in 2015. There&#039;s no excuse for that kind of stuff anymore.</comment>				</item>

The artwork is unabashedly surreal and totally unique for a board game; this little world gives me the same fantastical gut-spin as Beksinski, Dali, or Remedios Varo. The minis also fit right in and don&#039;t feel superfluous at all to me! This is simply a perfect production. Gorgeous.

The game itself is also surprisingly tactile, with good shared incentive patterns and meaningful spatial restrictions on the board. The static win condition is a refreshing departure from the standard point-conversion I was expecting, and it kept the game brutally focused, almost race-like. I&#039;m a little worried by how close each of my games have been, but until this proves to be an issue Blue Moon City is some more solid heads-up euro goodness from Knizia.

I will say that the brown, gray, and black cards / tiles are almost indistinguishable in the new edition, its the one fault I have with the visual design.</comment>				</item>

The card play felt lacking in variability and emergent combos, and the battles seemed a little anticlimactic, maybe even outright boring. The decks included in the box also felt constrained by their respective (and rather uninteresting) gimmicks.

The art is technically well made, something that can&#039;t be said for most card games, but the character design is often some flavor of goofy or hypersexualized, and so the thematic experience of Blue Moon ends up feeling disappointingly schlocky. The CMON edition of Blue Moon City thankfully moved away from this and did this world justice.

These dueling &quot;TGC in a box&quot; games always seem to suffer in the shadow of Magic, and none of them seem to make any effort to match Magic&#039;s level of nuance. I thought Knizia would be different, but this lackluster number-go-up tug-of-war attempt isn&#039;t it.</comment>				</item>

While I enjoy the fixed-hand rule immensely, it is a constant battle not to let my Magic-addled brain ruffle my cards. I wish the third field wasn&#039;t so prohibitively expensive, it feels like a trap for new players more than anything.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A super lightweight game whose only point of interest is a paper thin bluffing mechanic between the haphazard and game-less real time shootouts.

I’m exhausted by all of these family-weight games that don’t put enough effort into their rulebook. If you have special cards with specific timings, it must be abundantly clear when these cards can be played without having to come to a niche site like BGG. I understand the urge to thin the rulebook as much as possible to lower the barrier of entry, but it comes at a huge cost. Leaving it up to the players to argue over best guesses (which will inevitably happen when someone is on the receiving end of a dubiously timed card effect) sucks a lot of the joy out of a game like this. The best the rulebook offers here is an unhelpful and childish reminder to its players to “just chill out and be cool lol”.

Boomtown Bandits’ most baffling misstep, however, is that it unnecessarily disqualifies itself from being a family game (or at least one with wide appeal) due to its mandatory brothel location card. So this is supposed to be a silly, real-time shouting contest for…who exactly? It shot itself squarely in the foot with that thematic choice.</comment>				</item>

All three of my games have ended with scores so brutally tight that I&#039;m doubting there are any dramatic or important decisions to be made at all. The transparent mutualism of Bridges is admirable though, and I desperately [i]want[/i] it to work, so I&#039;m going to give it one more spin and see if the game is responsive to more aggression, but my hopes aren&#039;t that high.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It is an undeniably gorgeous abstract design, but even after dozens of wins I&#039;m still not sure I&#039;m totally following the chain of cause and effect on the board. It&#039;s not that the rules are unclear, I just can&#039;t seem to develop a set of heuristics for analyzing board position or making good plays.

The results of many of my games of Bug feel strangely arbitrary. That probably means I don&#039;t get it. I&#039;ll keep throwing myself at this wall until something sticks.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Fine little tactical abstract that is unfortunately bogged down by a laborious setup and some extraneous design elements. 

The terse Reef Encounter-esque market manipulation isn&#039;t as dynamic as it first appears, as animals have a tendency to just stick around whatever value they were assigned during setup, and scoring for each type by majority/minority makes tile collection an unnecessarily calculational affair. 

The set-collection categories also feel pretty unimaginative and further dilute the importance of the animal market, and the theme doesn&#039;t go far enough in capturing non-abstract gamers.</comment>				</item>

A rare example of a game that I feel could be improved by [i]loosening[/i] up the design. Have a drink Bus, you need one.</comment>				</item>

The fiddly megalith powers have an annoying combo potential that undermines any sort of worthwhile look-ahead and they create a devastating snowball effect for any player that gets an early material advantage. Without the megaliths the flipping action tiles could have been a very satisfying and meaningfully incremental engine, but they’re quickly overwhelmed by the annoying modern need for a “unique” power buffet.

The graphic design is also a little hard to read at times, especially the totem colors.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Camel Up is a charming and entertaining little betting game that doesn’t ask too much of its players, which makes it great for casual groups, families, or states of inebriation. Some races are definitely more exciting than others though, and if the dice come out in such a way as to hugely favor one camel over the others then the leg bets and end game bets can lose a lot of their tension. Dramatic comebacks or upsets are possible (and viscerally exciting when they do occur), but certainly not guaranteed, so there is some risk of having a bit of a dud game. It might have helped to have some way to directly place bets on second, third, and fourth place rankings, so there&#039;s still something to spar over even with an obvious winner or an obvious loser. I’m also a bit disappointed with how variable the effect of the crazy camels can be; they are an inspired mechanic, but I feel like I’ve seen too many races where their effect is negligible.

When Camel Up hits, it hits hard. I just wish it hit every time.

Also, while the production is obviously evocative, it dangerously treads the line between toy and game with the obstructive pop-up palm trees and the loaf-pinching plastic pyramid. Maybe I’m being stuffy, but these thematic gimmicks feel a little wasteful when more sustainable alternatives could have easily sufficed, like pulling dice from a bag. Oh well, at least it gets people excited to play.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Primarily a resource-conversion logistics game with some interesting topological constraints in the map building, but it ends [i]way[/i] too soon for any of that to matter, and the random tile draw can arbitrarily give someone an advantage in accessing vitally important and scarce secondary producers.

This feels like an earnest, if somewhat underdeveloped predecessor to Roads &amp; Boats, but it actually released three years after! I&#039;m unsure how to feel about Cannes given that fact, and I feel doubly conflicted on it because Neuland exists, which to me delivers a more meaningful (and luckless) logistics experience in a similar timeframe. Misstep from the Splotter boys.

Also, while Splotter&#039;s predilection towards satire and cynicism is usually appreciated, given the recent exposure of Hollywood&#039;s sickening treatment of women in the industry, Cannes&#039; Old Boys Club mechanic feels retrospectively tone-deaf and nauseating.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The goods tiles don&#039;t fit into Carcassonne at all for me; it feels like an oversimplified system from another game. Ownership fights over cities were already tense, they didn&#039;t need the help of a crude set collection mechanic.

The builders, by allowing double turns, create downtime that was usually (and thankfully) absent from the base game, and the pigs just enhance a feature that was already balanced, if they end up doing anything at all.

Carcassonne doesn&#039;t need any of this.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The Carcassonne mini expansion I hate the least. There is at least some decision making with the placement of gold bars, and they can occasionally shift the course of a conflict on the board. The increasing value of the bars is a little annoying to me, I would have preferred if they provided static VP.

Not needed, but not actively detrimental to the game; that&#039;s a feat in itself for these modules.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Moving the robber around the score board actively sabotaged our game because of how frustratingly similar the meeple looks to the one used for tracking your score; we spent several turns moving the wrong meeple, and realized it far too late to rewind the game state. 

We called it a wash and tried again to give the expansion a fair shake, and we did manage to get through a whole (painstaking) game without any mistakes in robber movement. For our efforts we were handsomely rewarded with an expansion experience that truly pushes the boundaries of pointlessness. 

Two games of Carcassonne ruined in different ways. Quite an accomplishment.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I was a little let down by Carson City after falling so hard for George’s other mechanism mish-mash game Ginkgopolis. While that felt like more than the sum of its parts, Carson City just feels…mushy. A little role selection, a little worker placement, a little Caylus-style building system, a little Santiago-style board networking, and a little dice rolling to add variety. It all works fine, but the intersection isn’t particularly lively or inspired. 

I might revisit this again to see if my feelings change, but only if someone else suggested it.</comment>				</item>

If you want a more complex eurogame, go play a more complex eurogame; don&#039;t try and force Catan to be something it isn&#039;t. This is the absolute worst kind of expansion.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Mean-spirited and mentally exhausting. With Caylus I once again find myself in the awkward position of admitting that the game that &quot;invented&quot; a mechanic (justice for Bus) is simply better than most of its vastly more popular imitators. I don&#039;t [i]want[/i] to be an insufferable cult-of-the-old contrarian, really I don&#039;t! But the worker placement here is just wonderfully crunchy and brutally interactive: building ownership; increasing assignment cost to place workers as players pass; provost positioning; considerations of round length and game length. Every element makes every placement of every worker a delightfully tortuous exercise.

However, all of these overlapping mechanical considerations make decisions slow, and paired with its intrinsic pacing Caylus becomes quite a long game. Not overlong mind you, the hours seem to fly by during play, but the experience is uniquely taxing.</comment>				</item>

That openness is essential for me, so I&#039;m not a fan of the fully produced, prepackaged versions of this that have come around like Time&#039;s Up! or Monikers. They&#039;re just too rigid in their celebrity choices and round structure, so the game loses its remarkable versatility. Just have everyone write down some names (or places or things or anything) and toss them in a bowl.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A surprisingly poignant little demonstration of the thrill of breaking unconscious taboos in gaming. Throw that card (that precious unsleeved card) on the floor or stuff it into your pockets or step on it with your shoe. Slay the oh so sacred cow!

This is very much a group-dependent game though, and requires everyone involved to buy in to the experience and play in good faith (not cheating away cards too quickly and admitting when you&#039;ve been caught). Maybe that smacks too much of &quot;you can cheat but you can&#039;t [i]cheat[/i] cheat&quot; for some people, but if a group is on board and has a good sense of humor there are few other games that are as earnestly irreverent. </comment>				</item>

It punishes blunders so decisively, with so much giddy exuberance, that a good game of Chess is measured far more by the absence of mistakes than the presence of skill.

The necessity of well-timed cooperation and defection clearly relies on thoughtful, intentioned play from all players, so I&#039;m constantly worrying that my dumb ass is bringing down the experience, but if I can ignore those voices long enough Chicago Express is a grand old time!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Intense, thought provoking abstract with a surprising amount of bluff and subterfuge, which gives it a warm personality that many classic euro-abstracts lack.

After playing at every count, I think it’s best at 3: the balance between player colors and “neutral” colors is perfect. 4 feels like the weakest player count by far; the incentives become “too” overlapped and it can be too chaotic.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Very cube-rails-esque. Investing in locations on the board instead of into the companies themselves is a fascinating inversion, as is the eschewing of any sort of share auction in favor of an action card draft at the start of each round. The dilemma between securing endgame positions and chasing after those sweet sweet short term payouts is also compelling.

The components do suck though; the microscopic chits should be replaced by cubes immediately.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The only classic family board game that was any good. As shocking as it may sound, the deduction in here was actually quite subtle. Good players care just as much about other players&#039; turns as their own, and constructing questions to maximally eliminate possibilities took some thought. There was even some maneuvering allowed in tracking which cards you had shown to the other players to exploit any of their redundant suggestions.

Of course, the capricious noise of the dice movement ruins all of this good stuff. Maybe one day I&#039;ll come back and try the dice-less variants that get thrown around here, but with so many good modern deduction games vying for attention, I&#039;m not sure that day will ever come.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>There is some game in here, but there may be too much of a positional problem with Coloretto: a weak player can end up unintentionally gifting points to the player on their left, and the scores are usually close enough that it matters. For a game that is [i]this[/i] much of a lightweight filler, requiring such a delicate skill balance between 4+ players is a tough sell.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Smooth-as-glass design, but almost entirely noninteractive save for some cursory, usually incidental interference. The interweaving of the cards into the map and goods system and turn structure is all meticulously refined, so its a shame that at its core Concordia is just another heads-down optimizer game that exists in the highly competitive 90-minute time slot. 

Be warned, though I personally enjoy the deck-building score system, I have seen new players bounce off of it completely due to its opaqueness and reliance on light memorization, so it can be a hurdle. </comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Perhaps the purest economic game I’ve played; inspiring for producing such intensity of play from such a minimalist rule set. The lack of guardrails and level of mutualism in Container’s economy is all fascinating of course, but in a dry, abstract, “suits shaking hands in a boardroom” sort of way. When compared to my other favorite auction games like Modern Art or Chicago Express, which are [i]exciting[/i] and even sardonic, Container feels morose. Beige. 

The only gripe I have with the rules system is the strange and hard-to-explain exception of being forced to dump your 5/10 containers if they’re tied with another color. I understand the strategic intent of the rule, but it’s an inelegant sticking point that I’m not sure is worth the effort.

I also much prefer the short variant; very little seems to be lost by taking a few containers out of the supply, but everything is gained by getting Container in under 70 minutes.</comment>				</item>

Tile management in the vault is a little too cerebral for how intentionally meatheaded the rest of the game is, but that&#039;s kind of my only gripe with the system.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Yet another limited communication coop that just isn’t specific enough about its communication limits in the rulebook. I’m so tired of playing games like these for the first time, forming an opinion of the experience, then coming to BGG and discovering that the community interpretation of these limits is almost entirely opposite of what is written in the rules. 

The publisher has even released an official statement that (in my opinion) directly contradicts the printed rulebook. So fine, I’ll try this again with the intended rule set, but this type of unnecessary ambiguity always sours the experience for me.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>An absolute classic card game that is just too easy to master. With just a few hours of hand analysis in a digital version the discard patterns become painfully obvious, and with very little effort you can learn to approximate perfect play. At that point Cribbage becomes a drawn out coin flip.

I have deep, fond memories of playing Cribbage with my family, but its decision space is depressingly small.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Refreshingly unforgiving spatial and tempo puzzle. The inherent variance in the tile supply and truck deck, paired with the ability to &quot;cut&quot; or redirect pipe segments easily by layering tiles makes Curious Cargo a game of wild, seat-of-your-pants organization and reorganization.

This doesn&#039;t come naturally to every player, and AP can become an issue in this regard. This can be alleviated somewhat by simultaneous construction phases, but then actions can become hard to audit. Giving each player a set of &quot;counting tokens&quot; for tracking actions is extremely helpful for this.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Keeping the same words over multiple rounds is an interesting twist on most word-guessing games, and this is probably the best of that bunch. It does end up having similar problems though: things can slow down while the clue giver is thinking, and because of the additional consideration of the opposing team&#039;s knowledge it can slow down quite a lot. 

I also happen to be shockingly bad at this one, so I&#039;m sorry to anyone who happens to get teamed up with me.</comment>				</item>

I think this might be one of the only games with a board that can actually go toe-to-toe with card games as a [i]true[/i] filler for four. Part of me does crave a little more arc to the experience, so I&#039;m excited to try the &quot;block cycling&quot; variant and seeing what extra oomph there is to be found in a slightly longer game.</comment>				</item>

Building and playing a deck at the same time was a revelation to me, and while its brilliance has faded somewhat after hundreds of plays, this still remains my favorite deckbuilder. The static market gives Dominion a potent strategic edge that many of its successors lack, and victory points clogging up your deck is a divisive tension that I enjoy. The art truly ([i]truly[/i]) sucks, but mechanically this is still king of the hill.</comment>				</item>

I thought the image of the two individual game boxes was a placeholder for selling the game in online stores, but it&#039;s actually printed on the box. I laughed out loud when I opened the package. It&#039;s so deeply hideous that I just can&#039;t bring myself to use this for its intended purpose. You know, a big box.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>With all the assorted bells and whistles of the original design stripped away, I came to the surprising realization that I don’t actually enjoy the original Dune as a war/area control game, and that the effort to isolate those elements of the design (a seemingly admirable task) ended up entirely missing the point. All I wanted were my bells and whistles back.

Just play Dune. Sink into that game space with all its retro campiness and baffling thematic edge cases. Don’t use this as any sort of stepping stone; take the full plunge.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>While undeniably dynamic and elegant in its design and presentation, I just can&#039;t bring myself to love The Estates. The capricious uncertainty of property values overwhelms any sort of control I feel I have over the system, even accounting for the potential of strained alliance between players: the point values are just too swingy and the fate of your investment too opaque and the ownership of buildings too zero-sum. While many auction games suffer from overly-transparent lot values, The Estates is an interesting reminder that the opposite is also true. 

It&#039;s also a little too mean for its own good, but I may just feel that way because I frequently lose. I&#039;d play Modern Art over this every time.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Ethnos had me under its snappy spell for a game or two, but my opinion of it has continued to erode with each subsequent play. The whole game absolutely [i]depends[/i] on the card market being filled by the players to make any impactful decisions with your hand (what region to play for, what power to build towards), but the card draw is so pitiful and building decent bands is such a slow process that excess cards are rarely dumped, and Ethnos usually ends up devolving into a painfully luck driven top-decking game of Go Fish.

What is truly baffling though is the decision to create two (two!) different special abilities that further undermine the essential card dumping mechanic (Centaurs and Elves). They all but guarantee the draw-pass syndrome that makes Ethnos so disappointing, and their presence is so detrimental to the game that I would urge simply throwing them out.</comment>				</item>

Maybe if there was a way to deny cards to your opponents without having to keep them in your hand (an opportunity cost that is almost never worth it) there could be enough interaction here to make this all interesting. Alas.</comment>				</item>

There are elements from every one of his popular designs in here, and admittedly AFFO is on the verge of bursting at the seams, but somewhere in the gluttonous sprawl lies a generous and surprisingly thematic game that continues to please me with its interlocking spatial subtleties.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>As close to perfect as an expansion can get: this is how the base game should have been (and I like base AFFO).

Modular action boards beautifully balance the game across player counts and make Odin feel overall less bloated, the reworking of the occupation system adds more tactical variety to the card management and makes dud effects feel less deflating, and the new exploration islands and special good tiles are wonderful, of course.

If Odin was ever re-released as a revised edition, it should without question integrate the Norwegians into the base game; it&#039;s that essential.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s pacing is good and player strategies can be fairly divergent, but it&#039;s a little too similar to Rosenburg&#039;s other resource shufflers to justify a place in my collection. The vehicles and buildings aren&#039;t enough to make this feel distinct, and most of those other games scale well enough to two players. It&#039;s also a little silly that a game specifically designed for two players didn&#039;t have its action board readable by both players sitting across from one another. Baffling design choice.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is solitaire Tetris (minus the timing, dexterity, and skill) hewn out of horribly wasteful plastic bits. 

The one interesting design feature is boards 3 and 4, but the layout of the symbols is fixed, so whatever (small) potential there was for tactical replayability is lost entirely.

This should have been a digital game for both design and ethical reasons. There is a whole world of complex variations and layouts that could have been explored in a digital space with this system, and it wouldn&#039;t have ended up in a landfill.

FITS is an uncharacteristic, uninspired blot in Knizia&#039;s catalogue. I hope it never comes back into print.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Finding clever moves in the sea of meeples is satisfying, and the turn order bidding system plays well to the changing board state. 

But it has some troubling undertones with the theming; fakirs (slaves in original version) are bought and sold on the same track as common goods, which feels weird no matter how much people cry &quot;historical accuracy&quot;. And a lot of the feminine djinns are depicted as ridiculously busty and revealing, even when they have more inhuman forms; which is an old, tired trope of fantasy art that should have died a long time ago. Save us Naga Vitalist.

I just don&#039;t see any reason why the theme and art had to be so off-putting. This is a tile-based abstract game with meeples. The theme could have been anything they wanted.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A simple territory control game split into two strange halves: first you build the map in its entirety, then you find a way to score points on it. The problem for me is that the game is really only played in the first tile-laying half, and Viking placements in the second half are fairly automatic and uninteresting; just following through on moves already made. You can usually determine a winner before a single point has been scored.

Why bifurcate the game like this for seemingly no gain? Why obfuscate an intensely straightforward scoring system with a delayed-feedback mechanism?

I&#039;m also not entirely convinced that bringing in more than 2 players was a good idea in this new edition. Having multiple things hit the board between each of your placements makes the game feel more lively, but also more swingy and even capricious. Lots of unsatisfying moments of Player A winning because Player B didn&#039;t stop Player C.

There are faster, more beautiful, more approachable, and more dynamic tile-layers like Taluva and Through the Desert that will maintain my attention over this.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A clean, fast, retro race without much game.

The differences in card distribution between the two racers makes them feel surprisingly distinct, and the slipstream and exhaustion systems are pretty evocative. But the tuning on those systems is just a little off; slipstreaming feels too strong and exhaustion doesn&#039;t feel like enough of a punishment, so the race can end up being excruciatingly close without anyone trying all that hard. It just doesn&#039;t significantly respond to creative card play.

I do wish that the turns in the track had a mechanical effect on the race so that changing the track layout would do more than just look cool. That was a missed opportunity.

Flamme Rouge also edges uncomfortably close to being overpriced for what it is. I was lucky enough to get a used copy for twenty bucks, and I feel like I got good value for my money, but I don&#039;t know how happy I  would be with the game if I had paid anywhere near MSRP. The extra thick chipboard and two piece minis just don&#039;t add enough to the game to warrant the extra cost.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Food Chain Magnate is almost unrivaled in the intensity and thoroughness of its satire, even considering Splotter’s high standard for such things. This is a devilish, biting caricature of 1950’s Americana that is one part infatuation and two parts denunciation. The pitch-perfect monochrome visual design, the horribly tokenized employees, the patently absurd marketing tactics, and the brainless, sheep-like, gluttonous behavior of the consumers all contribute to a repulsively amusing atmosphere that few if any games can match.

The jockeying for demand, supply, price, housing, and new restaurant locations on the board is mean-spirited and wonderfully spatial, and it is all deeply integrated with the tempo-oriented employee tableaus. The ebb and flow between these systems is tuned just right, and the rules overhead is surprisingly light for a Splotter.

But lurking under it all are the milestones. To me, they almost irreparably distort what is an otherwise striking example of Splotter&#039;s timeless, focused, elegant design philosophy; they feel uncharacteristically scripted, unimaginative, and tacked-on.

I understand their purpose is to provide a source of asymmetry between the players in an otherwise no-luck game, but funnily enough the fastest path to some early milestones is so obvious that they actually have the exact [i]opposite[/i] effect; instead of creating interesting asymmetries, they corral players into pre-planned, predictable lines of play (Train 1 Turn 2 or Hire 3 Turn 3) that dominate the strategic discourse around FCM.

That isn&#039;t to say that milestone-like effects don&#039;t work in principle. FCM&#039;s closest relative, The Great Zimbabwe, has similar first-come-first-served abilities in its Gods and Specialists, but they come at a static cost of VR, the dynamic cost of game-state information, and (crucially) the benefits they provide are almost always exploitable by the other players because of TGZ&#039;s mutualistic economy. The significant and unilateral milestone benefits in FCM (that are gained for simply doing what you were going to do anyway) seem positively draconian by comparison. It isn&#039;t enough that someone is already losing because their opponents were simply more efficient with their Recruiting Girls, this player now gets to lose [i]even more[/i] because their opponents will be enjoying permanent (and exclusive) reductions in their salaries. 

The whole subsystem is particularly brutal to novices, and the jockeying it creates between experienced players isn&#039;t very interesting or varied either. I truly believe that the randomized setup, initial restaurant placement, and emergent differences in players&#039; employee tableaus could have been enough to ensure player asymmetry without needing the milestones, but they&#039;re just too integrated into the system for me to seriously suggest omitting them. </comment>				</item>

The shrinking board was sort of interesting, but this is [i]still[/i] another lifeless symbol-matching coop from Matt Leacock, with unimaginative special powers and painfully obvious decisions. Maybe I&#039;d appreciate his games more if I regularly played with kids, but I&#039;m not quite at that stage in my life yet, so for now I can only say sorry Mr. Leacock, I just don&#039;t get it.

The production on this thing is pretty terrible as well; the metal tin is annoying to store, the trophy miniatures are totally unnecessary, the card stock is thin and flimsy, and the water marker pointer doesn&#039;t sit flush on the table when clipped in properly. The biggest sin though, is how blatantly the publisher has plastered their name on every single component that had printable space:

In [b]GAMEWRIGHT Ⓡ[/b] Forbidden Island, you will adventure to the homeland of an ancient civilization and search for buried treasures by working together, using special powers, and gathering [b]GAMEWRIGHT Ⓡ[/b] Treasure Cards. But beware, the island is flooding quickly! As the [b]GAMEWRIGHT Ⓡ[/b] Water Meter rises, players will be forced to draw cards from the dreaded [b]GAMEWRIGHT Ⓡ[/b] Flood Deck, which may see regions of the sacred [b]GAMEWRIGHT Ⓡ[/b] Forbidden Island sink into the abyss forever! A [b]GAMEWRIGHT Ⓡ[/b] game brought to you by [b]GAMEWRIGHT Ⓡ[/b].

I thought we had left this overly-corporate mass market board game stuff in the past.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Note: this rating is for the original ruleset [i]only[/i] (&quot;Fresh Fish Classic&quot; in new edition). Don&#039;t bother with the new rules.

Fresh Fish&#039;s deductive network building is shatteringly brilliant (after a small but painful learning process). Once the system is internalized, the board becomes a dynamic sea of implicit links, positional posturing, risk management, and tactical counter-play that continues to surprise and excite me.

If Fresh Fish was ever given a tasteful production that matched its system&#039;s violent beauty, I might consider it perfect.</comment>				</item>

Lengthier than its children, more austere than its children, more painfully procedural than any of its children, but as brilliant as the best of them. A worthy, if less immediately exciting, foundation for the series.</comment>				</item>

As has been said by so many others, the setup and teardown is prohibitively time consuming, and even a short session requires so much bookkeeping on the part of the game owner that the widespread description of Gloomhaven being &quot;D&amp;D without a DM&quot; feels disingenuous at best.

Enemy AI manages to be both error--prone [i]and[/i] dumb. You would think that a system opaque enough to spawn a challenging fan-made online quiz would produce more meaningful enemy behavior during combat. 

Constant modifier deck shuffling feels like a downgrade to custom dice or a bag of tiles for seemingly no other reason than to give players the illusion of less randomness.

The exhaustion/recovery system is needlessly restrictive, frustrating, and completely unthematic, and it is the only real source of difficulty in the whole game. Hoarding cards during the early portions of a scenario is crucial to ensure your character doesn’t become prematurely exhausted, but this means that most scenarios consist of hours and hours of piddling around with Move 2 / Attack 2 effects until you get to the last room and can actually start have fun playing the cards that make your class compelling. Gloomhaven makes no effort to emphasize the importance of this scenario cadence in the rules, and learning it yourself through several three hour delayed player eliminations early on is a vicious, depressing waste of time. 

The plot is paper thin and the writing is shockingly cliché for how original the world seemed from the outside. The campaign is also pretty unresponsive to scenarios being done out of the intended order; random characters that the party hasn&#039;t met yet will pop in and out of story segments, only to later be &quot;introduced&quot; to the party after circling back to their branching scenario path.

The treasure looting system and communication limits also breed so much tacit hostility with your &quot;teammates&quot; that I am convinced that Gloomhaven, like so many other coops, only works as a solo game. Considering that, why am I paying over a hundred dollars for a solo dungeon crawler that pales in comparison to even the most middling video games in this genre?</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>El Grande is ultra-refined and tightly integrated in the details of its design (the power card bidding, caballero court management, region scoring), but also willfully and delightfully exuberant in its broader strokes (the Castillo, the dials, the shockingly swingy action cards). It&#039;s aggressive, bluffy, well-paced, and just downright [i]fun[/i]. If all the old classic euros got together for a family reunion, El Grande would be the drunken uncle dancing on the banquet table.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The deterministic hands of cards counterintuitively creates [i]more[/i] tactical chaos despite a smoothing of the long-term randomness of the action decks, and this becomes especially overbearing when there are potentially [i]five[/i] copies of a destructive action card floating around at the table, instead of one or two. The distribution of the actions seems off as well, being tilted more towards court denial and straight up removal of opponents&#039; pieces rather than  caballero movement on the board, which always maintained a satisfying presence in the base game because one fifth of the action cards were variable move powers. This variation has been replaced by a static and unimaginably boring Intrigue card, which never allowed for the subtle caballero management of the base game&#039;s intrigue deck.

The fusing of the actions cards with the turn order bid also fails to capture any of the excitement or drama of the draft in the base game, and much of the texture of managing your opponents&#039; positions against the shared pool of actions has been lost. This, more than anything, is what makes this expansion a failure for me: for every interesting decision point K&amp;I introduces, it seems to equally neuter much of El Grande&#039;s wit and soul.

This is a radical variant with lofty goals, and I respect what it was trying to accomplish, but if El Grande had shipped like this, as the designer supposedly intended, I would have never taken to it. Sure, this was a crunchy experience on its own terms, but it wasn&#039;t the irreverent El Grande I know and love, and unfortunately for K&amp;I, this is a zero-sum game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I can&#039;t seem to feel anything but lukewarm on GWT after a few plays. Interaction is depressingly minimal, even for a heavy modern euro, and the strategic paths seem fairly isolated and lacking in meaningful intersection. There&#039;s also a distinct lack of drama in this; turns are so incremental and the whole process so procedural that I never felt clever or sneaky or bold, just vaguely busy. 

If I&#039;m going to dedicate 2-3 hours to a solitaire optimization game I&#039;d rather have A Feast for Odin for its system&#039;s rich interdependencies or Underwater Cities for its consistent dopamine dispensing.</comment>				</item>

The Great Zimbabwe is a dynamic and deeply mutualistic race of game-state manipulation and tempo management that condenses an absurd number of meaningful decisions into 75 minutes . 

Lush, inventive, and teeming with understated genius like VR costs and the Generosity of Kings turn order bid. This is Splotter at their absolute best.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It&#039;s a tragic thing, really. Hannibal is a fascinating and variable game of card-driven area control and strategic attrition that is very nearly ruined by an out-of-place and shockingly simplistic go-fish battle card system.

I&#039;ve tried to see the depth that many of the battle system&#039;s fans purport it to have, but after half a dozen plays I&#039;ve never once seen that depth realized in actual play. Just memorize the deck distribution, count your cards, and play what you have the most of. Whoever was dealt the better hand and rolled well enough to counterattack will win, tactics be damned, and almost no decisions will have been made during the whole laborious process. This weird mini-game inflates Hannibal&#039;s already long playtime for little gain, both in its procedure and its physical bookkeeping (make sure to shuffle up that combat deck thoroughly for the three hundredth time!)

I just fail to see what this subsystem accomplishes that another, faster combat resolution system couldn&#039;t have (dice etc). It&#039;s a shame, because the overarching board play with the strategy cards, army movement, and political control is genuinely great and tense, it deserved better.</comment>				</item>

Hansa Teutonica has now stood up to over a dozen thoughtful plays, and my respect and admiration for the design seems to continually deepen.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A Rosenburg game of thin margins and stuttering efficiency swings. The supply chain was as complex as I was led to believe, but Le Havre’s status as a sleek logistics game seem overstated; despite its differences in tempo it felt more like any of Rosenburg&#039;s other heavy resource/point conversion games than I was expecting. Throw it on the pile I suppose.

Le Havre also felt far too long for what it was, but that may have been because we played with four inexperienced players. I’ll return to this again, but I felt surprisingly lukewarm after a first play.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>On the verge of being really fun. Everything is tuned just a hair too complicated for a game that is meant to be kind of ridiculous: the sheer number of interacting statistics on the player boards and tactics cards and troop ability cards make combat opaque and prohibitively error-prone, rather than frequent and aggressive and decisive like the game intended. 

Maybe with enough frequent plays the cumulative effect of all these modifiers becomes easier to parse, but I personally don&#039;t want a big, stompy, raucous game like this demanding that kind of extended, focused attention to get the most out of it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This one is heartbreaking. I want to love it so, so bad. The raw [i]passion[/i] for the physics of space travel that HF exudes and the overwhelming expanse of the full solar system board are intoxicating, but in actual play HF ended up being a dreary, draining experience that doesn&#039;t properly communicate the grandeur of its subject matter.

My main issue with High Frontier is that its science and its thematic touches will only be cool to people that are [i]already[/i] into space; as a learning tool it&#039;s almost worthless. Its faithful simulation of the finer points of space travel (flybys, the rocket equation, Lagrange points, the Oberth effect) is pretty unbelievable for a board game, but if a player doesn&#039;t already have an intuitive understanding of these topics the game will seem like a nonsensical, arbitrary collection of number-crunching rules. I don&#039;t think anyone that hasn&#039;t seen an animation of a Hohmann transfer is going to gain any insight into the maneuver by zigzagging along HF&#039;s orbit lines.

Even when the movement system is internalized and the subtleties of each astronomical body is understood, the actual pick-up-and-deliver core of the game ends up feeling flat and weirdly unpredictable. The failure die is just such a bizarre and ham-fisted inclusion when HF is attempting to realistically simulate a human endeavor that is infamous for its regulatory prudence.

Maybe I would be easier on High Frontier if Kerbal Space Program didn&#039;t exist, with its almost limitless creative freedom and its pedagogical exuberance. And it also benefits immensely from the video format:  efforts in mission planning and execution are generously rewarded with vivid, breathtaking visual feedback (rather than the slight nudge of a plastic rocket pawn).</comment>				</item>

It’s not a bad filler though, and I respect it’s (unsurprising) mechanical completeness, especially the reverse auctions.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>After trying and trying to get this piece to work, I&#039;ve accepted that I just don&#039;t like what the Pillbug does to the game. Games warp [i]heavily[/i] around the positioning of this one piece, which feels imbalanced and a little inelegant, and the Pillbug comes with more rules overhead than every piece in the base game combined. It also lengthens the playtime of Hive well beyond what I consider reasonable.

While it does open up some interesting moves and defensive positions, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s worth the overhead and shift in focus. I think it&#039;s telling that Hive Pocket and Carbon still omit this.</comment>				</item>

Add this to the now quite long list of games that make me hesitant to ever sit down for another game of 18xx.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This is a sobering reminder of all the great, singular designs that may have been lost to the maw of 18xx. Here is a game that clearly borrowed heavily from the framework, but is so adventurous and self-assured as to stand firmly in its own category.

The merger system gives Indonesia a dynamism that I have found in few other economic games; companies change hands constantly as mergers are resolved for equally offensive and defensive reasons, and player positions become delightfully fluid.

The parasitic, catch-22 relationship between producers and shippers is fascinating, and never seems to play out exactly the same way twice. I’m a little sad I haven’t seen more of this asymmetric interdependency in other economic games.

I will admit that out of the box, Indonesia is (while undeniably beautiful) completely unusable as a game object. The map is two sizes too small, the wooden pieces and cardboard ships are two sizes too big, and tracking city demand with a pile of chits is untenable. Most of the components need straight up replacing, and that&#039;s a big ask for a game this expensive.</comment>				</item>

I&#039;m beginning to worry that Inis may have some fundamental issues, but there is so much potential for a great game in here that I&#039;m going to give it its due and play it a few more times before settling on an updated score. It&#039;ll rest here for now.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Endlessly variable and wonderfully bombastic card game that is a potent breath of fresh air amongst the hordes of games with ten times the elegance but one tenth the soul. Every game will see someone declaring that a particular card is broken beyond reason, only for that same card to be completely unnoteworthy in the next game, and another card taking its place as the bane of the table.

I&#039;ve never played the same game of Innovation twice, and I doubt I ever will. Like Magic, sometimes it&#039;s a blowout and you have a bit of a non-game, but it&#039;s over in 25 minutes, you laugh, shuffle up, and go again. Electrifying in the moment, striking in the aggregate; this might be the most game you can get for fifteen bucks.</comment>				</item>

There are thankfully enough tools given to the players to influence the game length and the timing and distribution of dividends to ensure the variance doesn&#039;t feel oppressive or overtly unfair. This is randomness done right.

Irish Gauge gets right to the essence of the shared incentive decision space with even less rules overhead than Chicago Express, and would be my first choice for introducing cube rails to non-economic gamers.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>That’s it? A party game with almost no party in it. It doesn’t have the laughs of Celebrities, the insightful discussions of Wavelength, or the mechanical interest of Decrypto.

The main selling point (duplicate clues being eliminated) felt like a rare event, even at higher player counts, and I’ve only seen it affect the outcome of a guess a handful of times. Scoring 10+ doesn’t feel like much of a challenge.

I’m not sure why this is so highly regarded.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Solid blending of euro mechanisms that seem at first blush to be contradictory, but reveal themselves to be tightly integrated. Navigating the web of bidding, worker placement, logistics, and actually finding a way to score points with your lonely little pool of workers is an exercise in being pulled in ten different directions at once (in a good way). I’m not sure if this completely rises above its point-salad trappings, but Keyflower is a cut above its cousins.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The theme is fun, and the art is fun, and chucking dice is fun, but somehow all of these things added together makes for a pretty middling game. Most players in my group preferred combat (fun) to going for points (boring), but without a player going the boring route, the game stretches on too long. Eliminated players are also never that invested in watching the rest of the game play out, which is always a deal breaker for any game with player elimination.</comment>				</item>

But I feel that Knizia&#039;s iron grip of elegance and simplicity may have squeezed some of the life out of Tolkien&#039;s world. With just a few more allowances given to more expressive mechanical design this system could have captured the fellowship&#039;s story beautifully, but as it is the whole quest feels too static and the characters feel too lifeless.</comment>				</item>

This is a bluffy and tense engagement that usually lasts less than a half hour.

Lost Cities is severely lacking in the intensity of so many other excellent quick games for two (many by Knizia himself). Particularly Battle Line, which asks similar questions in a similar playtime but with far more cleverness and depth.</comment>				</item>

The spatial restrictions within your colony never felt that constraining or impactful, and so creating good groups of buildings felt more like raw set-collection rather than a result of creative tile placement, which is disappointing.

This also desperately needed a scoring reference for each player in the box; with ten categories of points coming from ten different building types a game can be easily lost by simply forgetting a point category.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>What am I supposed to do? The sheer [i]totality[/i] of Magic almost puts it beyond normal hobby game classification. Can this even meaningfully be compared to one-box board games or small-run LCG&#039;s/CCG&#039;s? I&#039;m not sure. Rating this at all feels wrong somehow, so I am hereby giving an official grain of salt warning: my perfect score here does appropriately express my infatuation with the design, but I feel that Magic is simply beyond the scope of BGG, and so any rating I assign to it should be disregarded for the purposes of comparing my rated games. Having said that:

This game utterly consumed a good portion of my adolescence. Magic was single-handedly responsible for making many of my friendships in school, friendships I still have! If I had to name the game that has had the most substantial impact on my day-to-day life, it&#039;s Magic hands down.

The design itself is strikingly simple, and seems designed from the ground up to strongly evoke distinct mechanical personalities through its color pie, personalities that are often delightfully mirrored in players. Few games can rival Magic&#039;s simultaneous gentle learning curve and staggering, overwhelming nuance. With some clean vanilla decks, a lifetime obsession can be introduced in only fifteen minutes.

The moment-to-moment card game of Magic is perhaps best preserved in limited play; sealed and draft events offer an exhilarating distillation of nearly simultaneous deck construction and play. However it is the relaxed eternal formats like Commander that allowed Magic to become a deeply personal and valuable vessel for self-expression in my group. With decades of design to pick through, our little kitchen table micro-meta has had all its player personalities vividly codified in deck construction in ways we hadn&#039;t seen in standard play. Our decks, with all their pet cards and bitter reactionary inclusions and exuberant jank have become nothing short of hallowed ground.

I might not be as ruthlessly dedicated as I once was, but I return to Magic often, and even when I&#039;m not actively playing games I find myself  spending too many sleepless nights tinkering in the card database.  I expect to fall in and out of love with Magic for the rest of my life.</comment>				</item>

I&#039;m convinced that Mao serves no other purpose than to give cliquey, vain, hyper-competitive children the opportunity to exchange snickering glances with each other over how cleverly they&#039;re alienating and berating everyone who&#039;s not &quot;in on it&quot;.

What&#039;s that? I just hate Mao because [i]I[/i] was the quiet kid that didn&#039;t get the game and couldn&#039;t handle being made fun of? I don&#039;t see how that&#039;s relevant.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I was hopeful going into Mariposas because of the shared board, which  usually implies some sort of interaction or spatial jockeying between players, but sadly there was none to be found. You play your own little set-collection racing puzzle with almost no regard at all for your opponents. Even just a single rudimentary blocking rule (ala El Dorado) could have helped Mariposas [i]immensely[/i], and I&#039;m not sure it would have made it too mean for a family game.

Mariposas also relies heavily on randomized pools (action cards, goals, city tiles) that create restrictions that often feel arbitrary and make each round obsessively tactical. The iconography on the goals is also a little hard to parse, and interpreting above/below/left/right on a hex board goes a little beyond a family game&#039;s mental overhead in my opinion.

The theme is done reasonably well and feels unique, and the generational leapfrogging is compelling, but these elements are lost in all the tepidness. 

I feel bad for not taking to Hargrave&#039;s designs; she is such a wonderful ray of hope for the success of women in the medium, and I hope she has a long future in the industry. I just don&#039;t care for her games.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Shatters standard preconceptions. The first three plays felt downright magical as I came to grips with Martian Chess&#039;s slippery definition of &quot;my piece&quot; and &quot;your piece&quot;. Martian Chess seems explicitly crafted to subvert every instinct cultivated by chess-like games, and there is something wonderful about feeling so utterly hopeless in such a familiar game-space.

Once the cause and effect of the system is internalized though, the game seems to devolve rather quickly into stalemates and unwinnable positions. This is an amazing exercise in expanding your mind, but so far it hasn&#039;t stood up to extended play. Absolutely worth trying, but just for a bit.</comment>				</item>

Sure, this might be the more &quot;elegant&quot; of the two, but it lacks the excitement and the theatrics of Ra and is even more susceptible to overwhelming luck of the draw . Playing up to 6 doesn&#039;t earn you a pardon, Medici, good riddance.</comment>				</item>

While that sounds fascinating on paper, it really just means that your own turn is spent agonizing between often equally bad options and searching for ways to do as little as possible with your two pieces per turn; it&#039;s exhausting, never liberating or rewarding.

Medina also heavily rewards the player who is last to move in most situations (like with the frustrating tit-for-tat tower tiles), so many conflicts devolve into a stale war of attrition, including against your own supply of pieces. The game even entices players to collect a resource which lets them [i]abstain from playing the game[/i]! The game seems to admit that many times, the best move is no move at all, and while that isn&#039;t a broken strategic space by any means, and I recognize it&#039;s depth, I feel sort of bothered by it.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Cool concept, and so fun to see everyone finally get it. It&#039;s a worthwhile novelty, but anyone who has played improv games with similar structures (embarrassingly, me) might not be as blown away by it. 

I do wish that the rules were less ambiguous as to what constitutes &quot;coordination&quot; and &quot;secret signals&quot;. As I originally read it, I thought that all players had to remain silent and not make any facial expressions at all. I believed that this reading was supported by the repeated emphasis placed on timing, and nothing else, in the rules. The community disagrees, and I will admit that the Mind is a better game for it.

These types of games [i]need[/i] to be more explicit with their communication limits. It&#039;s absolutely no fun to argue with other players at the table about what communication is allowed based off of nothing but personal interpretation of the &quot;spirit&quot; of the rules. Playtest, find the best communication limits, then give detailed, clear, specific examples in your rulebook of what is and isn&#039;t allowed. Don&#039;t put the onus to police on your players.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Auctions, distilled. Having multiple auction formats in the same game is revelatory, and the respective tendencies of these formats to warp bidding patterns and influence player psychology is wonderfully prone to abuse. The delicate hand management and player-driven economy are equally powerful elements of the design; it’s amazing it all stems from a rule set that is a few paragraphs long at most, though I suppose with Knizia that isn&#039;t too surprising. 

This is an absolute evergreen, and adds enormous value to a collection, especially when its unexpected and delightful predisposition towards satire and roleplay make it so engaging to non-economic gamers who would normally be bored to tears by &quot;better&quot; closed-economy auction games like the Estates or Container.</comment>				</item>

The split tableau that Mottainai added also strangely makes it [i]harder[/i] to teach than it’s predecessor, despite being a smaller, faster game. 

I’m glad this exists so more people can get a taste of this system, but I also hate that this exists because it reminds me of the future GtR could have had. [i]Sigh.[/i]</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Another game-less collection of trivia cards. The questions are occasionally too vague and the data often conflicts with cursory google searches (a distressingly common trend in these types of games). The set-collection-based scoring is a thoroughly useless complication in the rules; it does nothing but unnecessarily lengthen the game and often makes players less enthusiastic about winning a round for a drink they already have. It should have been first to any five cards wins.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Hey It&#039;s FITS Legacy! Instead of following in its parent&#039;s footsteps by being a terrible game made out of chunky plastic bits that will end up in a landfill,  My City decided it was just gonna be a kinda okay game made out of plastic-varnished chipboard that will [i]also[/i] end up in a landfill. 

As a legacy experience, My City is deeply underwhelming. The enclosed chapters offer little more than slight scoring changes or mild spatial restrictions on the board, and even new tiles don&#039;t ever give the campaign any serious sense of progress or reinvention. The compensation stickers given out to players at the end of each chapter don&#039;t make anyone&#039;s board feel all that unique, and the cumulative campaign scoring was a pretty pointless &quot;goal&quot; to strive for, especially as the relative distances between players grew.

I just don&#039;t understand how the legacy genre has seemingly learned [i]nothing[/i] from decades of excellent single-player puzzle video game design. There are so many digital games that have shown the power and beauty of guiding a player through every possible permutation of a mechanism with intent, often leading to unexpected, mind-shattering subversion (Braid, the Witness, Baba is You, Opus Magnum). Having such a huge catalog of inspiration, why (why!) are legacy board games so afraid to push the boundaries of their systems? 

Why should I be impressed by a new building tile that can score a few more points or a new rock sticker or a slightly different start location on my player board? These are not interesting developments, they do not make me see the system in a new light or reveal previously unseen subtleties! It&#039;s just [i]fluff[/i], and it is made all the worse by the nature of the medium: this is made of physical stuff, designed to be thrown out after a playthrough. If you are going to make the creative (and ethical) decision to render your one-play game out of tree parts, you had better have a good reason. My City doesn&#039;t have one.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>While this presented a fascinating distillation of Roads &amp; Boats style logistics, with an increased emphasis on lock-outs and blocking, after a half dozen plays I&#039;m feeling like I&#039;ve seen all of Neuland&#039;s tricks. This is very much an &quot;aha&quot; game that wears out its welcome quickly once its admittedly inventive details have been understood: resources abstracted away to worker movement; variable action costs relating to distances on the board; the emergent potential of double-turns; the ability to choke out access to complex resources by blocking the supply chain &quot;upstream&quot;; and working through the supply chain efficiently over many turns by managing worker lay-down timing. It&#039;s all very, [i]very[/i] clever, but I fear only to a point. 

I&#039;m beginning to appreciate just how much the maximalist excess of Roads &amp; Boats contributes to its allure.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I was initially excited by the spatial and sequential combat puzzle, but the random tile drawing system felt like a completely unnecessary injection of high-variance luck into a nice crunchy battle system. Why not let each player select from a limited supply of units and one-time effects at will? Or at least have a rotating hand of 5-7 tiles? I just don&#039;t see what is gained from such a restrictive system.

This might need more plays.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Clever, crunchy modern euro. Noria&#039;s &quot;wheelbuilding&quot; could have so easily felt gimmicky, but the deterministic rotations give the system a clear sense of look-ahead that rewards strategic positioning of discs. The wheel perhaps becomes too forgiving when considering the additional rotation and swap actions though: near the end of the game when players are flush with knowledge tokens, the wheel seems to scarcely matter anymore, and that&#039;s a bit of a shame. I honestly would have preferred these options to be omitted entirely, or at least made prohibitively expensive.

I really enjoy the politician manipulation. It offers some impressively gritty player interaction and the competitive balance of locking in your own scoring opportunities while kneecapping your opponents&#039; is tense. The hugely valuable potential of a fully developed track incentivizes specialization, while the uncertainty of each track&#039;s maximum potential value incentivizes versatility. The dilemma works well.

These features are inventive, but Noria doesn&#039;t entirely escape its modern euro roots; this is still a resource converting engine builder under all the wheels and score matrix shenanigans. I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ll be discovering anything new from Noria on a dozenth play, but for now I&#039;m fond of it. 

I will say that it is [i]truly[/i] uplifting to have a game like this designed by a woman; the world of board game design is already uncomfortably dominated by men, and this is doubly true for heavy euros.</comment>				</item>

I do really enjoy the expanded adjacency mechanics in Oceans, it puts more direct focus on your opponent&#039;s tableaus rather than on a limited resource pool, but the resiliency of the species against extinction has removed some of the potency that was found in E:C.

The box is gorgeous but I don&#039;t actually care for the look of the components themselves, the fish tokens and trays are a little garish and don&#039;t really reflect the watercolor aesthetic of the box, and they feel overproduced for what is essentially a two-deck card game. Oceans probably should have been half the size and half the price.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A real-time pattern recognition game that strangely assigns different patterns to each player for the round, resulting in some players becoming arbitrarily hosed or even outright eliminated depending on the layout of the cubes. The ability to &quot;seed&quot; the distribution after seeing your needed colors is a nice touch in mitigating this, but the rules on forming valid sequences are so stringent that it rarely seems to help; someone is gonna get shafted.

I would never, ever play this over Ricochet Robots, with its intense and wonderfully frantic sense of communal struggle against a [i]shared[/i] problem (that is mathematically guaranteed to be solvable). This not only makes RR a more directly competitive and social experience, but allows everyone to fully recognize the cleverness of the best solution offered, something sorely lacking from the heads-down searching of Oraklos.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Feels particularly sluggish and antiquated in the shadow of its descendent Wabash Cannonball / Chicago Express, which offers just as much game in one third the time. There was also a surprisingly intense snowball effect that is usually (and thankfully) absent from Bohrer&#039;s other designs, which only made Pampas&#039;s length even more painful as differences in player positions became insurmountable. There just isn&#039;t enough flexibility in the Winsome cube-rails system to sustain a game of this length.

Side note: the income tracker included with the first edition uses an insane base-10 token system that makes it laughably unreadable at a glance. It is the worst game component I&#039;ve ever seen, and it is very dear to my heart for that reason.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>After a few dozen plays Patchwork reveals itself to be an unusually tactical and stressful zero-sum tempo game, rather than the more laidback polyomino puzzler I thought it was. Optimizing the leapfrogging action economy / button supply is really where the game is played, not in laying tiles well.

The cleanliness of the design is remarkable, but a game of Patchwork takes on a stuttering flow that feels strangely exhausting for such a light game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I [i]love[/i] the modular minis (probably more than I should), but the game seems to be a pretty drab economic resource shuffler with too many time-consuming auctions and too little excitement.

I&#039;m not convinced that the goods market really works as intended. Price fluctuations were [i]horribly[/i] sluggish; as a friend of mine put it, the state of the market seems to be reacting to what players did two rounds ago. Maybe that enables some clever speculation with advanced players, but for me the latency was overwhelming and made the whole thing pretty unresponsive to tactical play. The market also seems to break a little when goods bottom out to 0 and it takes forever for the prices to rise enough to incentivize anyone to make a sale, especially when there isn&#039;t a ton of time left in the game. I don&#039;t know, something just feels off about the whole system, and I don&#039;t have much desire to return to Planet Steam and find out if that was just due to inexperience.</comment>				</item>

Hold&#039;em is the obvious favorite (for a whippersnapper like me), but there is enormous joy in the other variants minus any form of draw poker. HORSE games are something else.

There is admittedly a [i]lot[/i] of downtime if you&#039;re playing competently, but with the right environment that&#039;s hopefully mitigated.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A game whose tight focus feels limiting rather than elegant. There seem to be too few point sources for what is often an eight or nine round game, so disparate levels of play can result in frustratingly similar scores. The two-currency system also feels a little wonky; the decision of which resource to use for a route often feels incidental. The requirement of needing an “escort” to use another player’s route also usually just ends  up getting in the way of the potential parasitism. A miss from Sylvester that feels strangely underdeveloped.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Reminds me heavily of Age of Steam in that the primary obstacles that players will be wrestling with are prudent budgetary planning and economic risk management. The route building is a little less interesting here though, and the same is true of the auctions (which have a tendency to swing wildly in value based on unpredictable deck ordering or player liquidity). 

Power Grid&#039;s win condition (in combination with its turn order system) also creates a strange hyper-fixation in players on setting up for a big last-round tempo burst across the finish line, which is a game cadence that I find personally unsatisfying; it feels a little sad to me that consistent, sound business decisions in the early and mid game of Power Grid seems largely overshadowed by this back-loaded brinksmanship.</comment>				</item>

The median values during dice drafting affecting a permanent turn order track was Pulsar’s most compelling subsystem, and I enjoyed the integration of a shared map. It’s still a lot of bland goal-based scoring and engine building effects under the hood, but I could see myself turning to this again when I fancy that type of experience.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Sleek and aggressive, with an obscenely clever dice system where movement, combat strength, cube construction ability, and special actions are all tied up into a single pip value. Chaining ship moves and abilities together on a turn is exciting, and the luck of the dice is used to great effect with ship reorganization and never feels overbearing during combat. The advancement cards also add a nice peppering of flavorful asymmetry that keeps Quantum from feeling too abstract.   

However, Quantum has a pretty intense &quot;rich get richer&quot; effect that is hard to ignore, with ongoing ability cards being given out for doing the stuff that helps you win anyway. Fans will say that this is justified by Quantum having such a short playtime, but I think that might be overstated. This is solidly an hour-long game (especially with larger maps and more cubes per player), and that isn&#039;t [i]quite[/i] short enough to take the sting out of an early tempo loss putting you on the back foot for the whole game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I unequivocally blow chunks at this, but Ra is a wonderful bidding game that is absolutely filled to the brim with charisma and sass under all the mundane scoring matrices and set collection. There&#039;s a little luck in here to be sure, but with a 45 minute playtime, a satisfying number of interesting decisions, and a heaping serving of melodrama, I can think of few other auction games I&#039;d rather play, if for no other reason than to yell &quot;RA!&quot; at people.</comment>				</item>

The deck is expertly constructed with only a few dud cards, engine building is sophisticated and diverse, and the phase selection system consistently rewards thoughtful analysis of your opponents&#039; positions.

My only problem with the system is the 6-cost developments. They frustratingly obfuscate the true score during the course of play, and their scripted, specific point conversions put a damper on the wonderful emergent properties of RFTG.  I wish they could all have been more like Research Labs, with more opaque and versatile synergies and use-cases, instead of literally doling out points for having specific cards ([i]by name[/i]) in your tableau.

Also, the art sucks. I&#039;m so, [i]so[/i] tired of having  to put up with bad art in otherwise excellent card games. I could easily see myself giving RFTG another point if it was nice to look at.</comment>				</item>

The solitaire mode is okay, but there are free, widely available digital implementations of RFTG with challenging AI opponents if you want to play alone, and the custom cards and additional player are strange additions that I don&#039;t think anyone asked for. 

The main mechanical draw, the goal tiles, can occasionally provide some interesting tug-of-war tension between players with similar tableaus, but for me they unforgivably dilute the nothing-but-cards elegance of the design and hinders its dynamism. The base game encourages you to pay some attention to your opponents to get a read on their incentives and make clever plays with your phase selection, but with the goals included this rewarding &quot;gut-check&quot; interaction instead becomes a repetitive exercise of counting your opponent&#039;s blue and brown worlds or counting their developments or counting their unique phase abilities or counting their cards in hand or counting their VP chips, all in effort to just throw a couple more unimaginative points on your score pile.

I might be willing to forgive the tediousness if the goals felt unique from game to game, but with such a tiny pool of tiles to choose from they feel samey almost immediately. Similarly if the goals had managed to drastically change the evaluation of your cards in hand they may have been worthwhile, but their effects are so bland that they mostly reward you for playing the cards you were going to play anyway. I understand the goals are meant to fill in some of the gaps in the deck, but that balance should have been provided by adding or changing cards, full stop.

The new cards and start worlds are genuinely fantastic. Really they are. I just wish they had come in a mini expansion by themselves, instead of packaged with all these superfluous materials and mechanics that detract from the base game.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>See thoughts on the base game under Blue Edition. This comment is for the modules included:

Railroad Ink with some weird chaos variants thrown in. The meteors are kind of charming and don&#039;t feel too terrible because of the point bonuses, but (like the Lake in the Blue Edition), the Lava is an ugly and confusing board-filling effect that just gets in the way of meaningful route planning. Both modules also feel expectedly unthematic, and kind of undermine the small amount of class the original edition had.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Another roll-n-write. I hate to suggest that an entire genre of games is incapable of being great (or even good), but when it is this [i]fundamentally[/i] solitaire it&#039;s hard to feel any other way.

That aside, the network building puzzle in the base game of Railroad Ink was interesting at first, but became flat and samey after just a few plays. Scores are remarkably consistent and hover right around 50, with only exceedingly good fortune allowing for much higher.

The modules included in the Blue edition aren&#039;t enough to save it either. The River is okay, as it contributes to route building and feels thematic, but the Lake is a confusing mess that looks ugly on the board due to nonsensical open ends and is far too hard to plan around.</comment>				</item>

Roads &amp; Boats now finds itself in the uncomfortable position of being compared to modern digital logistics games (Factorio) that have taken this conversion-supply-chain framework to dizzying heights, but there is something so tactile and immediately wonderful about the act of playing R&amp;B that keeps it from feeling obsolete, and its thematic touches are endlessly endearing.

It&#039;s the definition of a hot mess, and I simply adore it.</comment>				</item>

The thematic detail might be admirable, but the exception-ridden ruleset creates an unpleasant mental overload, all in service of an unnecessarily demanding resource shuffler. </comment>				</item>

Once everyone is up to speed, Root is fierce and tactical, but the overhead required to reach that point for four separate players (playing four separate games) is enormous, and is almost fatally exacerbated by differences in player experience or gaps between plays. I didn&#039;t really understand this until I taught Root to three brand new players having already played several times myself. It felt like a different game.

Despite that though, Root is a remarkable experience when everyone is on the same page.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Lavishly produced, but I am unconvinced that this has any meaningful or interesting decisions regarding hand management or character movement. Winning with King positioning seems rare, which feels thematically imbalanced and doesn&#039;t make the most of the Court&#039;s somewhat compelling spatial restrictions. Most games seem decided by who is lucky enough to abuse the high-variance movement of the Wizard and Jester to farm crown points. Weak showing from Knizia.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Undeniably striking in its presentation, but fairly mild in play. The non-polygonal board seems fascinating at first, but the rigidity of the tile laying means the spatial restriction is mostly meaningless. Tiles mostly stay right where they are and fights for victory tokens become heavily localized, overly tactical little squabbles.

The end game scoring is also so coarse-grained that games often seem decided by thin, unsatisfying tie-breakers. While some games like The King is Dead have managed to make this scoring work, it feels very wooden here. Maybe it’s the insistence on hidden scoring when token majorities are simple to calculate.

My opinion of Samurai might be far higher if I had played it back in the day, but I think it has been entirely eclipsed by more modern designs that follow a similar game-arc, like The King is Dead or Babylonia especially.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Light, zesty area majority game with clear inspirational ties to El Grande. The core “I cut, you choose” mechanism is implemented very well here, and it has meaningful subtleties with balancing short-term and long-term point payoffs. It also happens to look quite pretty.

But It can be somewhat prone to over-analysis when it comes to distributing cards, which can balloon the playtime heavily, and its extremely restrictive player count keeps it from being tabled as much as it deserves; this is a three player game, no more and no less.

Small house rules: player order for choosers simply rotates every round rather than being randomized, and the Banishment action removes a fixed number of cubes: a regular d6 is just far too swingy, if this had a custom die of 3-3-3-4-4-5 I&#039;d keep it in, cause I like the risk management aspect of the action.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A fine classic euro with some toothsome denial and negotiation, but a little too rigid in its board development thanks to the multiplicative scoring causing insanely strong incentives to create big, uninteresting groups of like crops, even for those with a minority yield. The watering system might also be a little too &quot;do or die&quot; for my tastes, especially in the last round when crops will dry to completion and the canal overseer position becomes exceedingly powerful.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Well...the time has come. I have finally found the inner strength to admit to myself how mediocre Scattergories is. I have been a long-time defender of this game because of fond memories, but the joy I was finding in here for the salesmanship of bad or surreal answers to prompts is now better found in games like Quiplash or Say Anything without all the headache-inducing letter nonsense.

I&#039;ll also maintain that the alliteration bonus in Scattergories is one of the worst rules in all of gaming; it incentivizes ridiculous and unfunny strings of barely related words that work against whatever lightheartedness was left in this box.</comment>				</item>

The hybrid euro-combat seems interesting, and occasionally hits, but I wish that combat was either less costly or less directly correlated with earning stars to encourage players to actually interact in the middle of the game, rather than stand around waiting to rush for two assured victories to close things out.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Well this is just delightful. The paper publishing mechanic isn&#039;t quite as bluffy or risky as I anticipated, but the puzzle and the presentation is wonderful.

This is a great example of how to use a companion app well: it speeds up learning, speeds up play, and vastly improves the solo experience. Allowing players to play on different difficulty levels in the same game is a brilliant touch. Other games could benefit from a polished helper app like this.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>It was fine with the grandparents as a kid, but even with the glow and glory of youth I still remember this being fairly uninteresting. This is one of those games whose success depended on its reimplementation of standard card deck symbology, which made it more accessible to an older audience, but alienating to a younger one. Could be a candidate for a  makeover into a modern family euro with some art and thematic coating.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A cacophony of one-upmanship with an appropriately schlocky sci-fi facade. There is friction, humor, and good-natured suspicion lurking behind every hasty, poorly planned deal, and the factions play off of each other (and the players themselves) in unexpected ways.

The experience of playing Sidereal Confluence is exhausting and exhilarating and certainly fun, but its inherent complexity seems to be fighting against the wheel-and-deal nature of the game. I worry that at high levels it might lose its irreverent charm.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Good expansion for a great game. The event deck pushes players towards a more tactical, intuitive playstyle, which I enjoy, and the new board tokens open up some interesting design space for the new spirits, but it all comes at the small cost of a more cluttered board and a more cluttered headspace. Spirit Island&#039;s clarity suffers slightly as a result, but my opinion might change as I grow more accustomed to the effects of the new systems.</comment>				</item>

Veto rounds foster a wonderfully parasitic relationship between shareholders, and the possibility of disastrous rail line isolation or consolidation gives these rounds some considerable teeth. One of Knizia&#039;s most opaque and mean-spirited designs, and also one of his best.

I must admit that the first play will be simply miserable for most new players; the monopolistic game-arc is almost impossible to envision without seeing it play out first hand, so first impressions of Stephenson&#039;s Rocket may be vey poor.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Welp, this one is just painful now. After getting a chance to try Ra and seeing where Sumatra&#039;s design DNA came from, this isn&#039;t just the mind-numbingly uninteresting experience I thought it was in isolation, it&#039;s a clumsy and ill-conceived maiming of a great game.

The shared board is little more than a round tracker with a single, vapid &quot;stay or go&quot; decision conducting the point-to-point movement, and instead of the dramatic and soulful push-your-luck of the lot creation in Ra, each location visited here represents an utterly, shamefully dry drafting round, with all the same set-collection point sources ported over directly, minus the fun disaster tiles.

With the new reprint of Ra coming into production, this game should simply not exist.</comment>				</item>

However, the rewards to be gained from these bidding rounds are mostly unimaginative set collection pieces whose value is entirely transparent. The one exception takes place on the board, where careful network building and look-ahead is required to score for the temples. The issue is that the route building involved is difficult to coordinate and the rewards for doing so are almost always strictly worse than just getting another elephant token or whatever. Taj Mahal squandered its one interesting spatial feature, and the board ends up feeling like an afterthought as a result.

Besides that (admittedly personal) shortcoming, I still can&#039;t find much to love in Taj Mahal. The card play feels a little too automatic and the &quot;game of chicken&quot; feeling I mentioned earlier can sometimes feel like a far less interesting war of attrition in key regions. Games also seem to consistently run close to 90 minutes, which for what it offers feels about 30 minutes too long.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>What wasted potential. Using hourglasses as playing pieces is such a unique idea, and TAMSK has striking table presence, but aside from the temporal gimmick TAMSK is a flat and tedious combinatorial game. Turns feel automatic, blocking is all but impossible, and move restrictions only become relevant after several dozen busywork moves around the outside of the board. Move place move place move place move place bleh. 

I was hoping that TAMSK would be a hidden gem, a game that went tragically under-appreciated in its day, that I could singlehandedly rescue from the archives with my infallible, discerning taste. 

It’s not. This was rightfully dropped from the GIPF project, and isn’t worth revisiting. The people were right on this one.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A hefty but sleek euro of parasitic spatial influence and efficiency races. The ebb and flow of the power wheel is the standout mechanic, and the faction asymmetries ensure tactical variety. It’s a good game, simple as that.

I can’t help but dislike the implementation of the cult track; it’s the only element of the design that feels tacked on to me, and it makes the whole package feel less focused. I wish that the priests / elements were integrated into the main board state instead of relegated to such an uninteresting tracking board. It’s by no means fatal to the experience, but I feel it may have been a missed opportunity.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A fiercely and profoundly unremarkable card-based tableau builder that has somehow wormed its way to the top of the charts.

A big chunk of the deck and most of the standard projects do nothing more than nudge a cube up a track. Engine building effects (aside from income increases) and emergent combos are vanishingly rare. There is very little sense of growing complexity aside from having a bit more money to throw around in the later turns.

I&#039;m not a fan of how few cards you are offered per game, especially when so many are hyper-specific in their use cases. The beginning of each generation usually becomes a tiring exercise of turning down a small pool of obviously useless cards, and there are even games where some players are implicitly disqualified from winning because they never saw any of the condition-less cards that are desperately needed in the early game. It&#039;s rare, but not rare enough for a game of this length.

Fans will say that the drafting variant helps this by increasing the number of cards you see per game, but relying on an advanced variant that slows the game down to a crawl to only somewhat fix a central issue feels lame.

And despite everyone playing on a shared board, spatial player interaction is almost nonexistent, and the board state has no meaningful connection to the card tableaus aside from some cursory special tile placements. The board mostly feels like a big VP tracker.

Even the interesting theme has been corporatized into depressing staleness. There are older and newer games in this genre that look better, play better, and cost less. Seventy bucks for TM on the BGG shop is insane.</comment>				</item>

The communal graph building through the jungle, area majority jockeying, and management of scoring timing are all compelling. The auctions in the advanced variant felt a little flat.

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>I tried lying to myself, and it worked for a while, but after mulling over a dozen digital plays and a few in person plays I&#039;ve had to accept the fact that Titan just isn&#039;t what I want it to be. The promise of epic, 80&#039;s-style fantasy warfare was just too intoxicating I guess.

Most of Titan&#039;s runtime is consumed by a painfully laborious process of moving your stacks of cardboard chits to gather more cardboard chits, a process that manages to be both unrelentingly calculational due to the complexity of the master board and muster chart, and overwhelmingly arbitrary because of the roll-to-move system. Sure, an expert player may be able to maneuver across the board and muster units with stunning,  graceful odds-mitigation, but for any ordinary human being these turns will be arduous and tremendously long as you figure out what the hell the game will allow you to do this turn. It doesn&#039;t help that so much of this is dependent on memory, as Titan gives you almost nothing to track what units are in what legion beyond a cutesy symbol; every one of your half dozen legions will have to be picked up and fiddled with every turn, and it&#039;s a pain in the ass.

Occasionally, though, the monotony is broken by a tactical little dice-chucking mini game that unfortunately only involves two players at a time. Everyone else just has to sit around and get their thumbs a-twiddling for the twenty or thirty minutes it may take for those two idiots to stop having fun. The whole concept of &quot;zooming-in&quot; on the board and resolving a battle as a sub-game is undeniably exciting, but when put into practice with actual humans sitting at the table it becomes immediately apparent how absurd the suggestion is, and how laughably dated.

Putting aside the logistical concern of leaving half the table unable to play the game, the actual tactics on the battle boards are fairly interesting, though it is extremely disappointing that the personalities of the fantasy creatures are abstracted away to just two number values; no special abilities or thematic asymmetry here, just more dice or a slightly higher hit percentage. You work [i]so[/i] hard to claw your way up the muster chart to recruit these colossal beasts; having that effort be rewarded with just a slightly larger integer is more than a little deflating.

And all of this will take [i]hours[/i] and [i]hours[/i]. Maybe if I had grown up in the 80&#039;s and had all the time in the world to blow on playing Titan I would understand why this is so adored by so many, but I didn&#039;t, and I don&#039;t. Sorry Titan, I loved the idea of you.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Sweet, precise, and visually delightful classic euro with meaningful entanglement of player positions. The dimensionality of the castles and the rules for knight movement provide a surprisingly evocative thematic coating. 

Really only comes into its own with the Master variant (open action cards), but I&#039;m not convinced that the Master Cards themselves are good for the game; the point swings are often big enough that the card effectively reads &quot;If you do not complete this goal, you lose the game&quot;. My preferred version of Torres would probably be open action cards, no Master Cards, highest -&gt; lowest score for turn order in a round. Maybe that&#039;s a bit of a Frankenstein, but I think the spirit of the game is still there.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>This might be the first true three-dimensional board game I’ve played; the merging and separation of groups of cubes in vertical space is enticing, and I appreciate Town Center’s commitment to the unintuitive paradigm.

However, something feels sort of [i]wrong[/i] with the design. The money to point conversion is so abysmal that any arduous attempts at milking buildings for income throughout the game are completely overwhelmed by residential scoring, and the money itself is used for very little else. 

The merging of residential units into large scoring groups becomes the sole strategic outlook of Town Center, and those mergers are dependent on a very limited supply of offices, which often end up unevenly distributed amongst the players for no good reason, and which require a strange $5 payment that seems to only ever matter when screwing over an arbitrarily poor player in the early rounds. The control given to the first player to secure/deny any drawn offices through the cube draft also feels…off.

I think this may have needed some more development time to find the game in here, cause it’s got good spatial bones.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>My first roll-and-write. Some clever use of dice probabilities, and some decent summit variations, but  the puzzle isn&#039;t interesting or challenging enough to make up for the complete lack of interaction.

The system is so simple and the course of play is so lonely that a game of Trek 12 feels more like a back-of-the-magazine brain teaser than a board game you sit down to play with (gasp) [i]other people[/i]. This makes all those sad, beige euros that people love to rag on for being multiplayer solitaire look like wargames. 

I&#039;m worried that the whole roll-and-write genre might be similarly reclusive.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>While the detail and potential for skilled play are readily apparent, I came out of my first half-dozen games severely let down.
______________________________________________________

The rawness of the tug-of-war system for controlling countries resulted in a lot of unsatisfying tit-for-tat exchanges during play and the consolidation of so much geopolitical subtlety into abstract Influence Points made TS feel unexpectedly disconnected from its theme. After just a few rounds the Cold War veneer washed away and all I saw was a board of red and blue numbers and a bunch of red and white cards that made the numbers go up or down. It feels gamey.

This unfortunate feeling was further enhanced by the event system. Forcing events of the opposite player to trigger when a card is used for OPs seemed intriguing at first, but it ended up making my games feel disappointingly similar. With almost every event being forced to go off sooner or later, and with player&#039;s having such limited agency in their three actions (really two, accounting for the dubious balance of realignment), it just didn&#039;t seem possible to have any drastic narrative departures, and the overall game-feel was one of complete mercy to the deck.

Not only does this make TS&#039;s narrative arc too scripted for my tastes, but it also means that high levels of play in TS seem dependent on deck memorization and careful maneuvering around the specific requirements of your opponent&#039;s events. Encouraging this type of hyper-detailed foreknowledge is personally unsatisfying as a player, but also undermines TS&#039;s thematic bedrock: that the Cold War (to the best of my understanding) was a cultural epoch defined largely by crippling [i]un[/i]certainty. 
______________________________________________________

Most of all though, I [i]heavily[/i] dislike the type of dice randomness that TS employs. The probabilities of each roll are transparent and drama-less, and the only two possible outcomes for any scenario usually boil down to a painfully binary yes or no. If you roll badly on a space-race discard, you just don&#039;t make any progress at all (cause everybody knows rocket scientists are prone to just winging it). If you roll badly on a Quagmire/Bear Trap check, you just [i]don&#039;t play the game[/i] until you roll better. The dice don&#039;t become a source of tactical reassessment or granular risk management, they just get in the way and become a depressing parental lock. Coups are the notable exception to this, as the rewards gained are determined by the strength of the roll, something I wish more effects in TS would have emulated.

With the combination of so many binary die rolls and the variance in the card deck, the likelihood of playing a non-game of TS seems to be worryingly high. Someone got all the neutral 4-OP cards the first time through the deck, or someone had to sit out for four (or nine in one of our games) rounds due to Quagmire, or just the right scoring cards randomly came back out of the late war deck to favor one player over another. I&#039;m sure that in the aggregate, strong TS players win more often than not, but this level of wild unpredictability is not easy to accept when games can be 3+ hours long.
______________________________________________________

One last gamey nail in the coffin: having the active player be the sole loser in the event of Nuclear Holocaust is ridiculous. It creates insane incentives for one player to enact mutually assured destruction on their opponent&#039;s turn if possible because even if you pull the trigger, you can still die a winner off a technicality.</comment>				</item>

Emergent combos are frequent and satisfying, deck penetration is tuned well, the Era decks ensure a good game flow, and the color coded action system and tight worker placement made turns tense. You can include me in the camp of people who think this is Terraforming Mars done right.

I understand that the Battlestar Galactica implementation has a significant pedigree, but I can&#039;t see myself ever wanting to try any version of this system again. This was skill checks upon skill checks upon skill checks to claw and crawl your way towards the end condition, with the added bureaucratic complications of dealing with random traitorous players.

I could see myself digging this with a hard 90 minute playtime, but sadly that&#039;s just not what these games are. I don&#039;t even think the game looks all that great; the board is unassuming and mostly empty space and the minis (aside from the Mother) look a little goofy to me.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>One step forward, more than a few steps back. The new wake up track is the only significant improvement for me. Everything else is some flavor of bloat that works to dilute what little Viticulture had going for it in the first place.

As soulless as the base game was, its tight, satisfying resource chain of vines to grapes to wine to orders to points was well crafted. Tuscany chips away at that completeness by providing too many opportunities to score points at each step of that process. I appreciate that this was done to address the luck factor present in the base game, but I feel its a net loss.

By opening up the board to a full four seasons the threat of competition for worker spaces has been almost completely removed. That was the one, small piece of player interaction Viticulture had, and it is further degraded by the addition of the special workers, which often break placement rules.
 
And the new star token area control mini-game is easily one of the most incongruous and tacked on expansion modules I&#039;ve ever seen. It&#039;s a completely bizarre addition that has been woven into the new action spaces, so it&#039;s impossible to leave out like the other modules. A baffling and distracting inclusion.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Fairly delicate balance of tactics and pool building, with an interesting central conceit of strengthening a unit by sacrificing its action potential. However, the intelligent tactics afforded by the pieces is quickly overwhelmed by the variance of the coins.

High quality production aside from one glaring graphic design oversight (coins cover control icons entirely, could have used a green border).</comment>				</item>

It might not capture the real literary essence of LOTR, but it has significantly deepened my appreciation for the depth and breadth of Tolkien&#039;s world. 

That would be an impressive feat for a book written by a Tolkien scholar. For a board game? Unthinkable.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>The production is very pretty, but the gameplay is dreary and lacking in many decisions. Most everyone&#039;s  tableau feels distant and samey, and there aren&#039;t enough tools to influence the type of engine you build. You just make the best tactical decision every turn and see what the game allows you to do.

Even so, in all my games, no matter what general structure of tableau any player has created, laying eggs consistently becomes the most efficient way to score points near the end of the game for everyone. It&#039;s a shame because the eggs are the least interesting mechanism in this whole box, they shouldn&#039;t be the main focus of the last few rounds.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Not what I wanted it to be. Very little silliness and very few laughs; the cases are so dependent on silent concentration and rote memory that the inherent joy of the &quot;Telephone&quot; structure is lost in all the logic. Witness is trying to be both a cerebral deduction game and a lighthearted party game, and for me it failed at being either.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>A tasteless, administrative adaptation of a great tactical skirmish game. 

The real-time elements feel unfaithful to the original and attempt to manufacture some shallow tension for the upkeep tasks of each round. The game would be entirely unchanged if these steps were performed in turn order.

XCOM (the video game) always maintained an intense and emergent sense of identity for each soldier, each mission, and each playthrough through its wonderful intersection of probabilities, but these have been reduced to near meaninglessness in the board game. The nail-biting odds manipulation of the original has been crudely rendered with an unimaginative push-your-luck dice mechanism, soldiers are faceless, nameless units without any defining mechanical traits, missions are little more than a list of icons and rewards, and the progressive gameplay arc is undermined by the random, unresponsive card decks.

I respect some of the interplay between the player roles, but the separation of all these game elements amongst four player leaves me feeling like I&#039;m only ever playing 1/4th of a complete experience. And that experience is widely available on multiple digital platforms for half the price!

This is yet [i]another[/i] game that has been released in the last ten years that feels to me like it is recklessly and needlessly struggling against the constraints of the medium, and I&#039;m forced to ask myself the same tired question: why am I not just playing a video game?</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Perhaps the cleanest and most approachable of the GIPF games, but no less cunning and certainly no less dynamic. After finally seeing my way through the whole series, my opinion of its poster child has stayed unexpectedly high. This is still a wonderful abstract, and its mechanism for equalizing the players after a point is scored feels like the holy grail of a game rule: like it was [i]discovered[/i] rather than designed.</comment>				</item>

Forcing captures from your opponent to set up your own future captures is ZERTZ&#039;s fascinating, vivid core idea, and because these forced captures result in your opponent necessarily gaining [i]something[/i] in the process, the game becomes a taut struggle of maximizing your gains while minimizing your opponent&#039;s against a shared, scarce supply of resources. Dear lord, Is this an economic game in disguise?</comment>				</item>
